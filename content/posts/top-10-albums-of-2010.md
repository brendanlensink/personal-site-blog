## 10. Ariel View - Until My Lungs Are Cleared

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyZrBroq69w)

I got to see this band open for the Beths earlier this year and was pretty impressed, then came home and listened to the one single they had released at the point on repeat for days. The album came out a little while later and continued to stick with me, the hooks are catchy and these ladies rock.

## 9. Tyler, the Creator - IGOR

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gvEfIbGJxQ)

Tyler has come a looooooong way from Goblin, and this album is another big leap forward. Made even more impressive by the fact that he produces everything himself, this has some great features, great samples and real feelings.

## 8. Lana Del Ray - NFR

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uFv9Ts7Sdw)

Lana's voice and strings are pretty much all I need in my life.

## 7. James Blake - Assume Form

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnvobi3ctsE)

The features by Rosalita and Andre 3000 really bring this album home, as always James' production and songwriting is spot on.

## 6. Slowthai - Nothing Great About Britain

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZsNnuaUSNs)

Slowthai was everywhere this year, crossing between genres with the help of the spectacularly talented produced Mura Masa. This is the kind of album you'll wither love or hate.

## 5. Freddie Gibbs & Madlib - Bandana

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjkeIJX8c3k)

For what it's worth, I think Freddie's one of the most talented rappers alive right now, and Madlib delivers the way he always does with soulful beats that are always interesting.

## 4. Clairo - Immunity

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18)

Breathy female vocals with minimal instrumentals and some insanely catchy hooks. If this isn't a Brendan album I don't know what is.

## 3. Carly Rae Jepson - Dedicated

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1biiKO_q_eM)

[This article](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/12/carly-rae-jepsen-dedicated-interview-more-confident-in-my-weirdness-now-olive-oyl) has an amazing story of how Carly managed to get the rights to a Disney song and rework it into something modern, funky and wonderfully catchy. This album makes me very happy.

## 2. Kehlani - While We Wait

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjGj99eQIqQ)

This album took me by surprise, but every time I listened to it I couldn't help but think about how damn good every song is.

## 1. Charli XCX - Charli

* [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chSZCtLrgz8)

Charli has shown up on my top 10 list pretty consistently since I started doing this, so it shouldn't be a big surprise that her first full length album since 2014 shows up here.Charli is so spectacularly good at bringing in diverse and talented features and adapting her style to go with them. I don't think many artists can have songs like Click, with its sensory overload outro transition right into a song like Warm and pull it off.As always, the production is spot on and Charli delivers on keeping things interesting from start to finish.
